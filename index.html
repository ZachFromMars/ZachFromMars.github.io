Fitter, happier.<br>
More productive.<br>
Comfortable.<br>
Not drinking too much.<br>
Regular exercise at the gym, three days a week.<br>
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries.<br>
At ease.<br>
Eating well, no more microwave dinners and saturated fats.<br>
A patient, better driver.<br>
A safer car, baby smiling in back seat.<br>
Sleeping well, no bad dreams.<br>
<a href="/world.html">No paranoia</a>.<br>
Careful to all animals, never washing spiders down the plughole.<br>
Keep in contact with old friends, enjoy a drink now and then.<br>
Will frequently check credit at moral bank, hole in wall.<br>
Favours for favours, fond but not in love.<br>
Charity standing orders on sundays, ring-road supermarket.<br>
No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants.<br>
Car wash, also on sundays.<br>
No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows, nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate.<br>
Nothing so childish.<br>
At a better pace, slower and more calculated.<br>
No chance of escape.<br>
Now self-employed.<br>
Concerned, but powerless.<br>
An empowered and informed member of societ, pragmatism not idealism.<br>
Will not cry in public.<br>
Less chance of illness
Tires that grip in the wet, shot of baby strapped in backseat.<br>
A good memory.<br>
Still cries at a good film.<br>
Still kisses with saliva.<br>
No longer empty and frantic.<br>
Like a cat<br>
Tied to a stick<br>
That's driven into<br>
Frozen winter shit, the ability to laugh at weakness.<br>
Calm, fitter, healthier and more productive.<br>
A pig in a cage on antibiotics.<br>
