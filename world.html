The Beginnings of History (August 26, 2020)
	• Pre-History vs. History
		○ History began when we learned to keep records for the sake of keeping records
			§ Pre-History started Millions of years ago (like five million) and ended around 10,000 BC
				□ Almost nothing changed during pre-history
					® People spent most of their time finding food and not dying
					® Many people were nomadic hunter gatherers
		○ Our life spans (80ish years) are the blink of an eye
		○ History really started around 3500 BC, and goes to the present
			§ Gap of 6000 or 7000 years between prehistory and history
				□ (Transition period)
				□ This is where lots of people switched to farming
		○ 3500 to 500 BC
			§ First civilization
				□ Sumeria, Egypt, China, and India are the four river valley civilizations
				□ Agriculture begins in the Fertile Crescent in Mesopotamia
					® Here and not somewhere else because it has:
						◊ Fresh water 
						◊ Perfect soil
						◊ A fairly consistent and good climate
						◊ Resources like a variety of edible plants
						◊ They have the "Big 5" animals (the most important animals in history)

					® They want "God, gold and glory"
		○ 1750 to 1900
			§ Industrial Age
				□ Change driven by machines and technology
